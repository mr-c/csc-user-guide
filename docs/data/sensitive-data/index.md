# Sensitive Data (SD) Services for research: user guide

This manual, in CSC Docs, introduces CSC's Sensitive Data (SD) services. Below is an overview of the contents organized into distinct sections for **1)
processing sensitive research data** (SD Connect and SD Desktop, standard service) or **2) processing register data** (SD Desktop for secondary use, limited version). If you access SD services for the first time please refer to the introduction for more information. 
To navigate the user guide, click on the topics on the right-hand side of the page in the navigation bar, or use the search functionality.
