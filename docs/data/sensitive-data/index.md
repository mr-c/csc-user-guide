# Sensitive Data (SD) Services for research: user guide

This manual, in CSC Docs, introduces CSC's Sensitive Data (SD) services. The content is organized into two distinct sections for processing sensitive research data and processing register data. 

If you access SD services for the first time, please refer to the introduction for more information. 

Each section includes the service's key features and limitations, step-by-step instructions (marked as *advanced* if technical expertise is required), video tutorials, and quick solutions in the troubleshooting table. In addition, guidance for accessing the services and permission management is provided based on the data type and the legal bases for data processing. 

To navigate the user guide, click on the topics on the left-hand side of the page in the navigation bar, or use the search functionality.
