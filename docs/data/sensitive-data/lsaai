# Using Life Science Login to access SD Desktop 

The Life Science Login enables researchers to use their home organisation credentials or community or other identities (e.g. Google, Linkedin, LS ID) to sign in
and access data and services they need. It also allows service providers (both in academia and industry) to control and manage access rights of their users and
create different access levels for research groups or international projects. For more information see Life Science [Login webpage](https://lifescience-ri.eu/ls-login.html)
Is is possible to use LS Login to access the SD Desktop and SD Apply services, but only if the Life Science account is linked to your CSC account. Please follow the next steps:
